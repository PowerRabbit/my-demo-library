# My Demo Library
This is a Demo library I made for my presentation at TypeScript Live: CPH, 6 March 2024

The library illustrates a possibility of using Custom Elements in different frameworks.

## How to run
- `yarn install`
- `yarn lib` (this is a required step which builds the library)

Then you can run all 3 frameworks in different terminals:
- `yarn angular` (launches at http://localhost:4200/)
- `yarn react` (launches at http://localhost:3000/)
- `yarn vue` (launches at http://localhost:5173/)
